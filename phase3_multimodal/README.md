# Phase 3 Multimodal (Deferred)

Multimodal fusion work (text + audio/facial) will be added later.
Current files are placeholders only.

## Planned Components

- Facial embedding extractor
- Audio feature extraction
- Fusion training script
- Extended demo app

## Getting Started (Future)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Implement training and then run demo
```

## Notes

Phase 3 is experimental; design architecture before coding.

## Folder Structure

- `src/` — Python modules (placeholders)
- `demo_app/` — Streamlit demo (placeholder)
- `tests/` — placeholder tests
- `requirements.txt` — phase-specific dependencies
